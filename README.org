#+TITLE: Sketch mode
#+DESCRIPTION: Quickly create simple SVG sketches using the mouse

* Preliminary comment
  This is a new package that is still in development. However, its main
  functionality is very usable already. Any feedback is very welcome (probably
  most suitable by opening an issue).

  The =sketch-mode.el= start with listing
  TODO items describing features that are missing from the package.
  
* Installation
  When installing the package it probably still shows some warnings, you can
  safely ignore them.
  
  Either =git clone= the package and load =sketch-mode.el= using =load file=
  either manually or from =.emacs.d=.

  Alternatively you could use a [[quelpa][https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa]] with the
  following recipe:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
   (quelpa '(sketch-mode :repo "dalanicolai/sketch-mode" :fetcher github))
 #+end_src 
 then subsequently load the package with
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package sketch-mode
    :defer t)
#+end_src  

** Spacemacs
  Add the following lines to =dotspacemacs-additional-packages=
  
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
     (sketch-mode :location (recipe
                        :fetcher github
                        :repo "dalanicolai/sketch-mode"))
#+end_src

  Subsequently load the packages by adding the following line to =dotspacemacs/user-config=
  
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package sketch-mode
    :defer t)
 #+end_src 

* Usage
  Start a sketch with =M-x sketch= and enter values at the prompts (or prefix
  with =C-u= to use default values). Thanks to the =transient= package the usage
  is more or less self explanatory.

  Create your sketch and then save the file by pressing =S=.

* Sponsor the project
  Due to a combination of unfortunate circumstances, I am in an unfortunate
  financial situation (dependent on my family), while I would love to get a
  modest income. As you can see from my [projects page][link to be inserted]
  this is not because I don't do (I hope useful) work. It is just that I don't
  get paid, nor receive any allowance, for writing free software while working
  on a thesis. Anyway, although I really prefer to make software available to
  anyone who would like to use it (I know quite well the frustration of
  "financial exclusion"), I would be very happy with a donation from users who
  enjoy 'my' packages, and can easily afford it (e.g. by using the packages for
  their work). Of course, if you'd like to see this package (or any of my other
  packages) get developed further you could also consider to become a sponsor (I
  have no experience with this kind of business, but I guess it starts with
  letting users know about it).
