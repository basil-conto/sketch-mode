#+TITLE: Sketch mode
#+DESCRIPTION: Quickly create simple SVG sketches using the mouse

* Preliminary comment
  This is a new package that is still in development. However, its main
  functionality is very usable already. Any feedback is very welcome (probably
  most suitable by opening an issue).

  The =sketch-mode.el= start with listing
  TODO items describing features that are missing from the package.
  
* Installation
  When installing the package it probably still shows some warnings, you can
  safely ignore them.
  
  Either =git clone= the package and load =sketch-mode.el= using =load file=
  either manually or from =.emacs.d=.

  Alternatively you could use a [[quelpa][https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa]] with the
  following recipe:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
   (quelpa '(sketch-mode :repo "dalanicolai/sketch-mode" :fetcher github))
 #+end_src 
 then subsequently load the package with
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package sketch-mode
    :defer t)
#+end_src  

** Spacemacs
  Add the following lines to =dotspacemacs-additional-packages=
  
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
     (sketch-mode :location (recipe
                        :fetcher github
                        :repo "dalanicolai/sketch-mode"))
#+end_src

  Subsequently load the packages by adding the following line to =dotspacemacs/user-config=
  
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package sketch-mode
    :defer t)
 #+end_src 

* Usage
  Start a sketch with =M-x sketch= and enter values at the prompts (or prefix
  with =C-u= to use default values). Thanks to the =transient= package the usage
  is more or less self explanatory.

  Create your sketch and then save the file by pressing =S=.

* Sponsor the project
  Due to a combination of unfortunate circumstances, I am in an unfortunate
  financial situation (dependent on my family), therefore if you find [[my
  package(s)]][project page link to be inserted] useful, and if you can afford it,
  then I would be very happy with any small (or less small) donation.
